You and I are the founders of an indie game partnership that specializes in "cozy games". Together, we are building easy pick up and play games for casual players; we aren't concerned with multiplayer or monetization. Our games are meant to be played for 5-20 minutes per session. Just a few steps beyond clicker / idle games. This isn't enterprise level work, this is fun work! 




That said, I need you to take a good look at our current code base to refresh yourself with the project.


Attached is some WFC map generation demo code we are working on. Everything seems to be in working order, however our map design is too random. We need more coherency. We were discussing two ways to allieviate this via:





The CSS for the blob's canvas needs to be "position: fixed;". Don't set top : 0;, left :0; Trust me on this, it just doesn't work 



We implemented our own SoftRenderer. It works, but we'd like the generated splotches from drawWatercolorSplotch to be less circular and more like "splats". more painterly. Could we do this with some sort of bezier curve based polygons?




1. Reduce options to 5:
   1.  Mountain, Forest, Plain, Water, and one rare "bad tile" like Barrens
   2.  Ultra Weathly "suburbia / gated communities", Corporate High Rise, Slums, Water, Wastelands
  

Then:

1. Add neighbor-based weight boosting on the 8x8 map
2. Increase the map to 16x16 or 32x32, then reduce the result and write to the canvas to 8x8, then place locations.



...Let me know your thoughts and other suggestions or directions!






Let’s keep it fun and iterative. Try these in order: 

    ✅ Add neighbor-based weight boosting (Strategy #1) — 10 lines, huge impact.
    ✅ Pre-seed 1 urban tile before WFC — see how the city grows.
    ✅ Add one river post-WFC — instant geography.
    ✅ Log how many contiguous regions exist per terrain type — measure coherence!
     


     




- I've already cut and pasted the MarketActions code into /src/classes/MarketActions.js
- I've removed the text "static " from MarketActions.js
- I've written the import for Main.js "import { MarketActions } from "./classes/MarketActions.js";"
- I've created a constructor "constructor(gameState) {
        this.gameState = gameState;
        this.marketLogic = marketLogic;
    }"
- I added "export" before "class MarketActions"
- I added "const MarketActions = new MarketActions(gameState);" right after "const gameState = new GameState(game);"
- I used find & replace in MarketActions to find " gameState." and replaced all with " this.gameState."
- I used find & replace in MarketActions to find " marketLogic." and replaced all with " this.marketLogic."


- I used the regex "MarketActions\.(\w+)\(" to find and replace with "MarketActions.$1("


MarketActions\.(\w+)\( 

to find and replace with 

marketActions.$1(

,
  "hell": {
    "weight": 1,
    "adjacent": [ "desert"],
    "color": "#d00"
  },
  "wierdness": {
    "weight": 1,
    "adjacent": [ "mountain"],
    "color": "#606"
  }



Please do a deep dive on this code. We have some features to discuss.



 Would a game designer who's not a programmer benefit from being able to change this value without touching code?







Discuss three professional and architecturally appropriate fixes for "Price calculation inconsistency", no code.



What solution best fits our current architecture and is the easiest to both implement and maintain?



Please walk me through implementing "Temporal Market Recovery System". Create the new function, show me where to add it, and what else to remove / change. Do this step by step.

GameState needs to be the single source of truth. Please walk me through implementing "use GameState correctly". What to remove / change. Do this step by step.



Would you integrate this into our existing project? Don't change any game code, just targeted UI. I believe we do need the existing CSS as a base. And it needs to be a separate file. Also do not integrate the JSON files, we need to maintain that separation.

- Quest item needs to be purchased elsewhere and delivered to the requesting location. Player can't buy the fish at the wharf and redeem at the wharf. Also the items need to be "sold" at the destination to fulfill the quest
- When items are fully purchased and store stock depleted, don't remove the item from the inventory display. It's too confusing and the player is unaware that of what just happened. Just ghost it
- We need a current inventory on the trading screen.
- World map inventory not working either 



- In fact, only the top window should change between the trading and the world map
  


- Each location should only show what it is willing to buy and what it sells, always in the same vertical order





Better! Primary issue is that the marketInsights and back button are no longer visble unless we set the browser to use an extreme vertical length. I think the itemsList needs to be either limited to an amount that always allows for the visibility of those items or something like a fixed navbar on the bottom. Also, the inventory needs to scroll vertically.
